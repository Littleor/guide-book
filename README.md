# NexPCB -NexMaker

We have online guidebook. [www.nexmaker.com](www.nexmaker.com) and offline lab in NexPCB. This lab would arrange training, hardware design, prototype making,project test,etc. We would try to push hardware innovation in our community one by one. In the meantime,We reference [Fablab](http://fabacademy.org/)  to build our lab.   Now we test beta version in our lab. We would open after test the function 

It's cool if you can give us any advice. We would update the lab one by one. Thank you for your kindly support.
[Bob wu who graduate from fablab 2018](http://fab.academany.org/2018/labs/fablaboshanghai/students/bob-wu/)would support the fab according to  Fab Lab and real need.
